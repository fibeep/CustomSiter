# CustomSiter
# Project Motivation:
> During the first 8 weeks of my journey to become a software engineer,
> I learned the basics of frontend web development, however I also learned
> that a significant ammount of work is spent going back and forth between
> code and product in order to test different fonts, colors, padding values, etc.
> Thus, I made a tool that helps developers quickly visualize changes in order
> to save time and develop faster!
